# ABOUT ME

## I do comedy and I make the posters for the comedy.

Starting comedy as a freshman at Texas State University, making posters was a necessary part of gathering audiences for shows. This forced me to learn graphic design, which I would soon realize... was my passion. I've had the privilege of making it into a career and continue to do freelance work for various groups all these years later.

TODO this need to be formatted in a way that doesn't suck. Thats either me doing it myself, or its me ripping stuff from minimal mistakes and getting it to work
